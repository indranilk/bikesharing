# bikesharing

Overview of Analysis:

	In this challenge we are creating a report of all the bike sharing programs in Des Moines. We created a dataframe of city bike data including tripduration, startime, bikeid, and usertype. We changed the tripduration column from integer to datetime type. In the first part we used python dataframe to convert the tripduration to dateformat. In the second part, we made different visualization charts based on data from trips. We played around with information to format the charts.

The first trip duration had the highest curve in the number of bikes sold. The second and third trip duration have a flat curve.

This graph shows that the males had the highest curve in number of bikes in the first tripduration. The female graph shows lower curves in all durations.

In this graph the male subscribers have higher count of bikes compared females.

Summary

We had to play around with different attributes to get the count of bikes sold. We also filtered and sorted the data to get the correct results. From the graphs I observed that the males have the highest number of bikes compared to females. The two additional graphs that I created also showed which group of durations had the highest count of bikes.
